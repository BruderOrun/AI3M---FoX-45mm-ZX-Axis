# AI3M---FoX-45-ZX-Axis

Anycubic i3 Mega redesigned ZX axis with 45mm X gantry system

The Anycubic I3 Mega, known and as Ai3M, is an excellent entry level 3d printer. It has a rigid mainframe, a very good heat bed, decent electronics and a low acquisition price. I have to mention and the great community support for the Marlin firmware evolution. The main weak points are the unreliable hot-end assembly, the positioning of the heavy Bowden extruder attached to and way out from the center plane of the X-gantry, the sheet metal construction of the Z-carriages, week, wobbly and unable to correctly self constrain the geometry of the complete ZX axis, the lack of tensioning features for X and Y belts.  An uninspired design decision - to use a 50mm X-gantry system - has isolated the Anycubic I3 Mega from the i3 world of 3d printers, most of them built on a 45mm X-gantry system.  

Any 3d printing passionate and ambitious Ai3M user, once has passed the 3d printing childhood period, might feel the need to completely revise this printer or to move to another 'higher level" 3d printer. The options are: paying at least three times the cost of an Ai3M and getting a printer that might still needs upgrades, tinkering and care - or paying much less and turning the Ai3M into a machine that can finally offer perfect printing quality in a package with fun, enjoyment, a bit of challenges and a lot of satisfaction. 

The 45mm Ai3M "FoX" ZX axis design is developed for the users that would prefer the second option. The design intends to solve most of the mentioned Ai3M mechanical problems and returns the printer into the 45mm X-gantry i3 family, opening the large world of dedicated i3 45mm solutions - exemplified with a 45mm X-carriage derived from Prusa MK3 R2 carriage and the Bondtech direct drive upgrade extruder made for Prusa MK2-MK3. Excepting the extruder, the costs for this modification are in the range of 15-20€ or equivalent plus printing material/costs.  

Still reading after the "Why" and "How much" questions have been answered? Then the last question: "How?" - and the answer is: "not really easy". For an average user this modification should be classified as "difficult". More details and information about this modification provided on Thingiverse:

The models included in the main step file are partly gathered from various sources - Grabcad, Thingiverse, Github etc, partly new desigs. A great, renewed "Thank you" for everyone who spent time to digitize these models.  

Why "FoX"? - because the FoX has outsmarted the Bear :)
